Use reinforcement learning to train an elevator

In this project, I try to train an elevator (or more) using reinforcement learning.
The approach is to use an actor-critic model with a neural network for both the value function and policy distribution

See my website https://freecaenepeel.gitlab.io/reinforcementlearning/ for a detailed walkthrough.
